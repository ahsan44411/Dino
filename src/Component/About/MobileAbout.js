          We welcome you to the Ape Mansionaire Club, a unique NFT collection of
          1000 brave and powerful Apes who have stood the test of time,
          destruction and the post-apocalyptic ruins of Ordinals City. These
          Apes have taken over the Mansions of the city, becoming the
          Mansionaires,
           a fearsome group of apes who command respect and loyalty from
          all who cross their path.
